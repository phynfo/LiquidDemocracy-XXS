<h1>Representing Delegations (proposal level)</h1>
<p>All delegations created by a user are immediately representated (redundantly) on
the proposal-level. In the following, this proposal-level representation is
described. </p>
<h2>An example situation</h2>
<p><img alt="delegations" src="./delegations.png" title="a view of some delegations for one specific proposal 'prop1'" /></p>
<ul>
<li>The thick arrows mark the transitive delegations. </li>
<li>"person1" delegates "person2" for "prop1". Suppose that -- caused by
  other delegations (not depicted in this graph) -- "person1" has "vc=5", i.e. a
  vote count of 5 in voting "prop1". </li>
<li>Note that there has been an older delegation "del4" to "person5" for "prop1",
  which has been overwritten by "del1". </li>
<li>"person3" delegates "person2" for "prop1". Suppose that -- caused by
  other delegations (not depicted in this graph) -- "person3" has "vc=3", i.e. a
  vote count of 3 in voting "prop1". </li>
<li>In consequence, "person2" has "vc=9" (1 for his own vote, 5 for the delegation
  by "person1" and 3 for the delegation of "person3".</li>
<li>"person2" delegates "person4" for "prop1". </li>
</ul>
<p>In order to describe a dynamical view, the situation after adding a delegation
and the situation after deleteing a delegation is described.</p>
<h2>Situation after Adding a Delegation</h2>
<p><img alt="delegationsAfterAdd" src="./delegationsAfterAdd.png" title="the same view after adding a new delegation 'del0' which overwrites 'del1'" /></p>
<ul>
<li>"person1" added a new delegation "del0" which overwrites "del1"</li>
<li>the older delegation is kept in a kind of stack formed by "olderDel"-edges. </li>
<li>In consequence "person2" looses "person1"s votecount of 5. (This votecount is
  now  given to "person6". </li>
<li>In (transitive) consequence, "person4" also looses "person1" votecounts. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Situation after Adding a Delegation</h2>
<p><img alt="delegationsAfterDelete" src="./delegationsAfterDelete.png" title="the same view after deleting a the delegation del1" /></p>
<ul>
<li>delegation "del1" is deleted. If there is an "olderdel"-edge (which holds in
  this case), i.e. if there are older delegations in the stack, the recent
  delegation is restored. </li>
<li>Each delegation in this stack is always a delegation for the same proposal (in
  this case for "prop1". </li>
<li>In this case, "del4" is restored which delegates "person5" for "prop1". </li>
<li>In consequence, the votecount of "person5" increments by 5, and the votecounts
  of  "person2" and (transitively) of "person4" decrements by 5. </li>
</ul>
